Live Demo: https://leaf-and-bean.herokuapp.com/

Summary: Leaf and Bean is a full-stack app meant for an e-commerce coffee and tea shop. The app in it's current form is basically an a full CRUD admin view of the app, where the user can browse inventory, add inventory, edit inventory, and delete inventory. I would like to add more views for customer users as well, a shopping cart, and checkout capabilities in the future.

Technologies Used: MERN stack - MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js.

Approach: Utilizing the MERN stack (which prior to this project I had never worked with before) my goal was to create a full stack application with create, view, update, and delete routes to the backend database with a user-friendly and component based front-end. I chose this stack because having worked with each of the pieces separately in other projects, I was curious how they tie together and wanted to challenge myself to learn a new stack.

Unsolved Problems: I would like to continue to build out the app to be a fully functioning e-commerce app that customers could use as well as functioning admin capabilities.
